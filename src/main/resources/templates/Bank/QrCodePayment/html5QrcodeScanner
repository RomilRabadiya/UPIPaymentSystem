# 🔍 **What is `Html5QrcodeScanner`?**

`Html5QrcodeScanner` is a **pre-built scanner UI** provided by the library **html5-qrcode**.

It automatically gives you:

✔ Camera selection dropdown
✔ Live camera preview
✔ Scanning box
✔ Automatic scanning loop
✔ Built-in stop/start controls

You don’t have to build UI manually — this class creates everything for you.

# 🧩 **How It Works in Your File**

### Code:

```javascript
var html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(
    "reader",
    { fps: 10, qrbox: 250 },
    false
);
```

### Explanation of parameters:

### **1️⃣ "reader"**

This is the **HTML element ID** where the scanner will be displayed.

```html
<div id="reader"></div>
```

---

### **2️⃣ Scanner Configuration**

```javascript
{ fps: 10, qrbox: 250 }
```

* **fps: 10** → scan camera at 10 frames per second
* **qrbox: 250** → scanning area is 250×250 pixels

This helps reduce lag and improves scan accuracy.

---

### **3️⃣ Verbose Logging**

```javascript
false
```

* `true` = prints detailed logs
* `false` = keep logs clean
  You used **false**.

---

# 📌 **Start Scanning**

```javascript
html5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess);
```

### What happens here?

* It **creates the UI** inside `<div id="reader">`
* Turns ON your **camera**
* Continuously checks for QR code
* When QR is found → calls your function:

```javascript
function onScanSuccess(decodedText) { ... }
```

---

# 🛑 **Stopping the Scanner**

Inside your success function:

```javascript
html5QrcodeScanner.clear();
```

This stops:

✔ Camera
✔ Scanning loop
✔ QR detection

So the QR doesn’t scan repeatedly.

---

# 🧠 **In Short**

`Html5QrcodeScanner` = **Full automatic QR scanning widget**
It handles:

* Camera selection
* Opening webcam
* Detecting QR
* Showing live preview

You only handle: **what to do after scanning**.
