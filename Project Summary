## Project Name: RomilPay – Digital Payment System (UPI Simulation)

**Technologies:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, MySQL, PDFBox, ZXing (QR), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

### Description (Advanced / Resume-Ready):
Developed a full-stack, enterprise-grade UPI-inspired digital payment system enabling secure peer-to-peer transactions, multi-account management, and real-time transaction tracking. Implemented using Spring Boot microservices architecture with robust backend services, dynamic Thymeleaf-based frontend, and MySQL database for persistent storage.

### Key Features & Achievements:

#### Secure Authentication & Authorization:
- Multi-factor authentication with mobile OTP verification and PIN-based transaction security.
- Session management and JWT integration for secure API access.
- Encrypted PIN storage using BCrypt.

#### Comprehensive Bank Account Management:
- Multi-account support with primary account selection.
- Dynamic account operations: view balance, transfer funds, and set primary account.

#### Advanced Transaction System:
- Peer-to-peer transfers using account number or mobile number.
- QR code–based payments using ZXing library for generation and scanning.
- Full transaction lifecycle tracking: SUCCESS, FAILED, timestamped with audit-ready logs.
- Downloadable PDF statements with custom duration selection (last month, last 3 months, last year) using Apache PDFBox.
- Unique statement generation ensuring secure and conflict-free downloads.

#### User Interface & UX:
- Responsive, card-based dashboard UI with modern CSS styling.
- QR code visualization, dynamic transaction tables, and alert banners for errors/warnings.
- Smooth UX flow for contact payments, PIN confirmation, and real-time feedback.

#### System Design & Architecture:
- Layered architecture: Controller → Service → Repository → Database.
- Reusable services for transactions, PDF generation, and account management.
- RESTful principles for backend endpoints enabling potential API integration with mobile apps.

#### Security & Compliance:
- Input validation, transaction verification, and error handling for invalid PINs, insufficient balance, and self-transfer blocking.
- Secure handling of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
